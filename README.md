## ✨ What’s Inside

Java-Learning is my personal codebase for mastering core Java concepts—from object-oriented principles to algorithmic problem solving and app scaffolding. Each module lives alongside samples and exercises so you can follow the same learning path, experiment with code, and build confidence.

## 🛠️ Features & Topics Covered

- ☝️ **Core Java**: Syntax, OOP pillars (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction), exceptions  
- 🔄 **Data Structures & Algorithms**: Arrays, Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Sorting & Searching  
- 🏗️ **Design Patterns**: Singleton, Factory, Observer, Strategy  
- 🌐 **App Foundations**: Project scaffolding, package organization, build scripts  
- 🧩 **Hands-On Exercises**: Leetcode-style challenges with runnable code  
- 📚 **Documentation**: Inline comments, design notes, and conceptual write-ups

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java JDK 11 or higher  
- [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) or Eclipse (optional)  
- Git (for cloning)  

### Clone & Open

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kratugautam99/Java-Learning.git
cd Java-Learning
```

- **IntelliJ/Eclipse**: Import the project as a Maven/Gradle module or open the existing `.iml`.  
- **Command Line**: Compile and run via `javac`/`java` (see below).

---

## ⚙️ Build & Run

### Via IDE

1. Open `src/Kratu/company` in your IDE.  
2. Right-click any `*.java` file with a `main()` method.  
3. Select **Run** to execute.

### Via Command Line

```bash
# Compile all classes
javac -d out src/Kratu/company/**/*.java

# Run a specific program (example: Main)
java -cp out Kratu.company.Main
```
